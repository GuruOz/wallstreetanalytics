# Security Policy

If you are going to contribute to this project, please take some time out to read through this. Follow the set rules and NO exceptions. 

We focus on the following principles:

1. Validate input.
2. Keep it simple.
3. Default deny.
4. Adhere to the principle of least privilege.
5. Sanitize data sent to other systems.
6. Only store data that you need. 
7. PII and financial data MUST be encrypted

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, create a new topic in the Issues. Be straight to the point and precise. 


Types of vulnerabilities to report:

* Code quality issues.
  * We need overall quality and standardized code.
* Improper error handling.
  * Errors must only provide the necessary information to the user and not provide reveal any sensitive information
* Improper/non-existent input validation.
  * Focus on SQL injection and Cross-site scripting (XSS). 
* Sensitive credentials stored as code/config.
* Directory traversal.

This is a completely crowd sourced project and thus, there is no bug bounty as of now. However, this may change in the future.

## Known security gaps & future enhancements

Since the project is in its early stages of design, there is much to do before we can implement security measures. Keep a look out for this section in the future. Suggestions are also welcome.
